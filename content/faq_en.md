| **1. What maintenance do the sculptures require?** | Our sculptures are designed for minimal maintenance. Thanks to high-quality materials, they are weather-resistant. We recommend occasional cleaning with low-pressure water to remove dust and maintain their vibrant color. They do not require pruning, watering, or special care. |
| **2. What materials are they made of?** | Each piece is built on a robust and lightweight fiberglass structure, which ensures its durability and stability. The surface is covered with state-of-the-art artificial turf, with UV protection to resist fading and designed to emulate the appearance and texture of natural foliage. |
| **3. Is it possible to request a custom design?** | Absolutely. Creating custom pieces is one of our specialties. Our collaborative process includes an initial consultation to understand your vision, the creation of sketches and 3D models for your approval, and finally, the production of your unique sculpture. Contact us to bring your idea to life. |
| **4. What is the order and shipping process?** | The process is simple. Once a design from our catalog is selected or a custom project is approved, we begin production. The creation time varies depending on the complexity of the piece. We manage shipping worldwide with secure packaging and specialized carriers to ensure your work of art arrives in perfect condition. |
| **5. What is the durability of the sculptures and what warranty do you offer?** | Bacho sculptures are designed to last for decades. The materials are selected for their resistance to the passage of time and various climatic conditions. We offer a warranty that covers manufacturing defects and the integrity of the materials, ensuring your investment and peace of mind. |
| **6. Are they suitable for all types of climates?** | Yes. They have been tested in a wide range of conditions, from intense sun to snow and frost. The fiberglass structure does not corrode, and the artificial turf is treated to withstand humidity and temperature changes without deteriorating. |
